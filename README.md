## Why do you care?

Git is immensely popular and being able to interact with it as part of a build process can be very valuable
to provide a more powerful and consistent result.

## What is it?

gradle-git is a set of [Gradle](http://gradle.org) plugins:

* `org.ajoberstar.grgit` - provides a `Grgit` instance, allowing interaction with the Git repository
the Gradle project is contained in
* `org.ajoberstar.github-pages` - publishes files to the `gh-pages` branch of a Github repository
* `org.ajoberstar.release-base` - general structure for inferring a project version and releasing it
* `org.ajoberstar.release-opinion` - opinionated defaults for `org.ajoberstar.release-base`

See [Grgit](https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit) for details on the Git library used underneath, including
configuration for authentication.

## Usage

**NOTE:** gradle-git modules require Java 7 (or higher).

## Questions, Bugs, and Features

Please use the repo's [issues](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git/issues)
for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and are accepted through pull requests.

Smaller changes can come directly as a PR, but larger or more complex
ones should be discussed in an issue first to flesh out the approach.

If you're interested in implementing a feature on the
[issues backlog](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git/issues), add a comment
to make sure it's not already in progress and for any needed discussion.
